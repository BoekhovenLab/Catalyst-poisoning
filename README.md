# Catalyst-poisoning

We used the following set of ODEs to describe the systems by using a steady-state approximation that removed any explicit dependence on the concentration of O-acylurea and used an in house developed python model to fit the experimental data. 
The following set of ODEs was used and fitted. Ac stands for acid, F for fuel, W for waste, P for product and N for N-acylurea.
